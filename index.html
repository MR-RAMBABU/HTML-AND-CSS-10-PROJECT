                <h1>Cyber Security Expert</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is <b> Rambabu Kumar</b>, and I am a dedicated cybersecurity student with a strong passion for coding and technology. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at Himalaya College of Professional Education, where I am in my second semester (2023–2026) with roll number 153. I live in Chiksi Laligang, Patna, with my supportive family. My father is a farmer, my mother is a homemaker, and my brother is a skilled carpenter. I weigh 54 kg and take pride in maintaining a well-groomed appearance, including a good beard.

                    I have a competitive spirit and have won several quiz competitions, which highlights my sharp intellect and quick thinking. With a creative mindset and a knack for problem-solving, I aim to become a proficient coder and cybersecurity expert. I also plan to start a YouTube channel called BCW Mins (Babu Cyber Warrior) to teach coding and related topics, making complex concepts simple and accessible for learners.
                    
                    I value continuous learning and self-improvement, and I am focused on building a unique identity in the tech community. My determination drives me to overcome challenges and stay committed to my academic and personal goals. Inspired by my family’s support, I strive to make them proud while contributing positively to the world of technology. My dream is to leave a lasting impact as a knowledgeable and impactful cybersecurity professional.</p>
